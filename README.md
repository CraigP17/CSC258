# CSC258

This repo showcases my coursework and final project for CSC258, Computer Organization course.
The course labs involve programming in Verilog and testing code through simulations, using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) as well as connecting wires and chips on a breadboard and switchboard.

### Lab Summaries
**Lab 1:** Connecting wires and chips on the breadboard to implement different circuits

**Lab 2:** Creating a 4-to-1 multiplexer and a 7-segment decoder

**Lab 3:** Implementing a 7-to-1 multiplexer, 4-bit ripple-carry adder, and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU)

**Lab 4:** Creating a 8-bit shift register and a ALU with a register circuit

**Lab 5:** Creating a counter that counts at different speeds, an 8-bit counter using T-flip flops, and displaying morse letters on LEDR

**Lab 6:** Implementing a finite state machine to perform a function in series, and an FSM that detects specific input sequence

**Lab 7:** Creating a RAM block to read and write values to, and implementing a module to draw on the VGA monitor

**Final Project:** My partner (Jacob Rajah) and I created a morse encoder and decoder game where a letter is displayed on the VGA monitor and the user must use the keyboard to input the correct morse pattern associated with the letter shown. If inputted correctly, a LEDR light flashes indicating it is correct and the VGA will display a new letter. If inputted incorrectly, the VGA display and FSM will stay at the same state until the user correctly inputs the pattern.
